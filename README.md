# databa.se

I don't know what Databa.se is, sounds cool though.
I don't own the website Databa.se. I want to buy the domain but it's taken by a company called SYSTEMASIS AB. 
Although, I have high hopes to buy the domain of the company because it seems that they hgae given up on the project since it hasn't been updated in about 18 years now.

I have an idea that it could be a database sharing site, simple to use, simple to search, simple to share. Then using an api for most mainstream coding languages, make them accessible. Using this, you will be able to create or use a premade database that you can then use to store variables or access random photos, videos or other datafiles instead of doing complicated web-scraping.
